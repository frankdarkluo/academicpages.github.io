I am a junior student majoring in [Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/) in [Wuhan Univeristy](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). Currently I am a research intern in [WHU NLPLab](https://github.com/WHUNLPLab) led by [Prof.Min Peng](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/teacherinfo.aspx?id=271). My research interest includes information extraction, machine learning, computational social science and dialogue system. Previously I was a visiting student at [Cambridge University](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), I finished several projects during these programs.

About me
------
In my normal life, I like playing tennis and watching foreign movies, and I spare no efforts to study and do research in the lab during the rest of my time. I love to communicate with others about everything. Active thinking is my biggest advantage, and I always try to find effective approaches to solve problems. 

I also care for environmental problems on earth, I once volunteered in Nil Manel Foundation in Sri Lanka to protect sea turtles and orphan elephants for 7 days and learned a lot from the experience, you may read it [here](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzUwOTgyMTQxMA==&mid=2247483873&idx=1&sn=34bfba657e38b8c702f2ad1b5bd0c237&chksm=f90d296cce7aa07a926d8400d5eaf0192c3d70904ef1655744196a2370b34607603a0e4305c3&scene=126&sessionid=1588782409&key=0cfe94fe0f64e8a52d9ea2bd9abfd3ee8c5ef466256a21552616e5f9aa6b0334e3da898bf1646d8708073f2dfd5af72d8a6f3e4d389f8006e187d7d98fa6d2839d01dee483de179d2c382dd558151597&ascene=1&uin=MjA5NDMxNTA3Nw%3D%3D&devicetype=Windows+10+x64&version=62090072&lang=zh_CN&exportkey=AUBRzmLoJPeFaEIdecUzdck%3D&pass_ticket=WlRlSldhXFMdSGTO73zGQiFBiIhTtuGOYbLMtrJSo0kL%2BFT%2Beo143OVLAg4qdLEF).

Miscellaneous
------
* "Excelsior" is my motto.

* I am now the tennis team leader of School of Computer Sciene, Wuhan University, and also a team member of WHU school team. I led my team to be in QF and I got the [fifth place](https://www.frankgqluo.xyz/images/tennis.jpg) myself in "Wuhan University Tennis Open 2019".

* I'm also a basketball fan (of LeBron James and LA Lakers) and played SG. I am great at three-point shots and my nickname in middle/high school is "Luo Allen" (Homophonic to "Ray Allen"), although I seldom play basketball now.

* My favorite players are Roger Federer, Cristiano Ronaldo, LeBron James and Michael Jordan, I find that all the great players have a stable and long-lasting professional career.

* I am a big fan of Taylor Swift, I went to see her conert once in Gillette Stadium, Boston in 2018, which was deeply impressive! Here are [some photos & videos](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1W7U1VDWUdhYOfxzrXYXIoCXGAYjygHrL) to share.

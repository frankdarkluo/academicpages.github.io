I am a junior student majoring in [Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/) in [Wuhan Univeristy](https://www.whu.edu.cn/). Currently I am a member of [WHU NLPLab](https://github.com/WHUNLPLab) led by [Prof.Min Peng](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/teacherinfo.aspx?id=271). My research interest includes information extraction, social network analysis and text generation. Previously I was a visiting student at the [Cambridge University](), [Havrard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) and finished several projects during the programs.

About me
------
In my normal life, I like playing tennis and watch foreign movies, and I spare no efforts to study and do research in the lab during the rest of my time. I love to communicate with others about everything. Active thinking is my biggest advantage, because I always manage to find effective approaches to solve problems. "Craftsmanship" is my motto.

I also care for environmental problems in earth, I once volunteered in Nil Manel Foundation in Sri Lanka to protect sea turtles and orphan elephants for 14 days and learned a lot from the experience.

Besides, I hope everyone be safe in 2020, **stay at home** and take good care of yourself.
